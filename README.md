# AI-Driven-Personalized-Healthcare-Treatment-Using-Reinforcement-Learning

This project implements a healthcare treatment recommendation system leveraging Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Learning (DQN). It compares these advanced reinforcement learning techniques with baseline approaches, including a random policy and a heuristic-based policy.
